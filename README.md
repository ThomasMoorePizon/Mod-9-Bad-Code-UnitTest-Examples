# Mod-9-Bad-Code-UnitTest-Examples
This Mod has some bad code and some bad test cases to demonstrate the use UnitTest

In the badtestcase I have an incorrect testcase example.
In the badcode I have a function the should addtwo but adds three so all of the test cases come back as errors.

I ran
C:\Users\tpizon\OneDrive - ECMC group, Inc\Desktop\Python>python badcode.py > badcodeout.txt

C:\Users\tpizon\OneDrive - ECMC group, Inc\Desktop\Python>python badtestcase.py > badtestcase.txt

You can see both the sample code and the text outputs.
